# Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics 

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

## Requirements 

  ** Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
  ** Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods.
  ** Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
  ** The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 
  ** Create a Map: (1) Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top; or (2) Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
  ** Include a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during your analysis for the map.
  
  **Finally, create your final presentation
  * Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.


* Assignment is saved to Tableau Public Account
